Github Profile Review Project
=============================

This part(folder) of the repo deals various Do's for a github profile.  
The project tries to display the right ways to show off a project to the recruiters while applying for a job. This includes following a specific well explained formatted commit message, rather than being lazy to explain what changes were made for those commits.  


Usage
=====
To use this project, you can simply clone the repository to your local computer and work on your own, but if you wish to contribute, feel free to fork and make pull requests.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sreecodeslayer/ndlp_ml.git
$ cd ndlp_ml
```
